											<h1>Hi, I’m <br />
											Charlene Mncube</h1>
											<p>An Engineer, Passionate about Social-Tech Entrepreneurship</p>
										</header>
										<p>A Civil Engineer by training with a demonstrated background in programming, data management, and problem-solving, I am passionate about developing innovative solutions and strategies to tackle complex business problems in dynamic and purpose-driven environments, with a specific focus on the African continent.
											<p></p> With over three years of experience working in the engineering consulting industry, primarily on transportation projects at the Global Design Centre, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of world-class transportation projects in collaboration with colleagues from Australia and New Zealand. Throughout this experience, I have been responsible for various aspects of project management, including designing, modelling, drafting, project finance, and project reporting.

											<p></p>My passion for engineering innovation was the driving force behind my final year research project, which aimed to assess the impact of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution" on the civil engineering industry in South Africa. This research has since inspired me to pursue further personal projects and knowledge acquisition related to innovation adoption and implementation, particularly within the engineering and technology industries and it’s impacts on the communities of our country. I firmly believe in Steve Jobs' philosophy that: "In order to achieve great success and create revolutionary changes in the world, we must learn to prioritize the intersection of technology and the humanities, because that’s how the best ideas emerge". My approach to my work is focused on creating solutions to strategically position businesses whilst uplifting communities through the sustainable and progressive implementation of technology.
											
											<p><p> Alongside my technical proficiency, I possess strong interpersonal skills as I often engage with people from diverse backgrounds, whether in a boardroom with executives or at a braai with colleagues. Those close to me would describe me as diligent, witty, sociable, self-aware, ambitious, empathetic, and candid.
											
											<p><p>Skills: Engineering Design, BIM, Engineering Drafting, Spatial GIS tools, Project Management, Project Finance, Planning Studies, Report Writing

											<h3>Gap Year</h3>
											<p> Upon completing my matric, I took an unexpected gap year because of lack of funding. During that time, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery as I transitioned into adulthood and where I once attempted to join the SA Defence Force in the hopes of fulfilling my childhood fantasy of becoming a CIA agent - that did not work out :) .Despite the obstacles, I remained committed to my goal of becoming an engineer and determined to find a way to finance my studies. Through sheer resilience and persistence, I managed to raise funds by taking on various odd jobs. Eventually, I was able to register and begin my journey towards realizing my dream of becoming an engineer.</p>

											<h3>Investec Bursar</h3>
											<p>The journey as an Investec Bursar will forever hold sentiment in my heart. I remember after running in the rain trying to submit an overdue project, right after getting a call from Phangi who informed me that I had been shortlisted for the Investec bursary, at that very moment it felt like a had experienced catharsis. The realization that I had once applied for the StudyTrust bursary after matric and had been unsuccessful, only to be awarded StudyTrust's most prestigious bursary two years later was a full circle moment. I will forever remember the day Setlogane Manchidi personally called me to tell me that I had been awarded the bursary. And, the day Dr Murray Hofmeyer from StudyTrut agreed to cover my outstanding fees from the previous year.  Since then, Investec and StudyTrust have been intentional in my development as an aspiring young professional, and I will be eternally grateful for the impact they have made and continue to make for young dreamers like me across the country.</p>

										<h3>UJ Civil Student Society</h3>
										<p>As an active member of the UJ Civil Engineering Student Society. This organization aimed to foster interaction and networking between aspiring engineers and industry professionals. Being a part of this society was instrumental in keeping me engaged as an engineering student, as it provided a sense of community that made the university experience a lot less stressful.
											In addition to the community aspect, the networking opportunities offered through the society bridged the gap between my status as a student and my aspirations to become an engineer. The society also gave me the opportunity to participate in my first international trip, along with other experiences that I will always cherish.

										<h3>Impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the Civil Engineering Industry Dissertation</h3>
										<p>Like every Civil engineer I wanted to make the world a better place by building civil infrastructure for communities. However, I felt a bit underwhelmed with the picture I had in my mind versus the reality of the current state of engineering in our country. Things took a turn in my 3rd year when Dr Gabrielle Wojtowitz from one of the top engineering consulting companies came and presented on how they used AI and virtual reality for their engineering projects. My inquisitiveness for the synergy between engineering and technology was therefore born. In my final year studies, I wanted to do research on something unique and disruptive, something innovative to the very traditional civil engineer. I therefore chose to do my final year dissertation on “The Impacts of the 4th Industrial Revolution on the Civil Engineering Industry” in that year I was able to network and meet other like-minded people in industry who were well versed on the forthcoming emerging technologies and disruptors in industry. What excited me the most about my studies were the potential value propositions emerging tech had in place for the engineering industry and that I could be a voice and contributor to that change. </p>

										<h3>Explore Data Science</h3>
										<p>In my final year of studies, I was indecisive about which career path to embark on, as young bright minded engineer the options were plenty. I was sponsored by a private bank that largely exposed me to the banking industry and presented many non-traditional engineering roles in banking that I could pursue after graduating. I had three options: banking, data science, or engineering. This was during the surge of the data science and analytics boom, and I was undecided, experiencing sunk cost fallacy. After many consultations, I decided to give engineering a shot so that I would never have any regrets about not becoming an engineer. I then decided to take the engineering professional route. But just in case it was not for me, I decided to "career cushion" by furthering my education and broadening my career horizons through part-time studies in data science.

											This decision was made during the pandemic, and I had extra time on my hands to learn after hours. However, I must admit that it was a tumultuous journey. Being a new graduate and trying my level best to transition into that role at the engineering firm (remotely, on top of that) had its challenges. Coupled with a very demanding data science program, and the mental, physical, and emotional fatigue of Covid-19 and lockdown on top of that, it was a tough period. After a year of intense learning, I had successfully completed my course, where I learned a lot of programming with various data management, gathering, and visualization tools, as well as what goes behind the systems behind machine learning and the full data science pipeline.
											
											And now, what was the next step?</p>

											<h3>Civil Engineeringand and Beyond</h3>
											<p>I am now well within 3 years of my career as an engineer. The reality is that not much of the picture I had envisioned of innovation is happening in the industry yet. However, I work in the offshoring unit where I largely work on Australian and New Zealand transportation projects. Working on world-class projects with some of the best engineering minds in the world has been surreal, but there is still a disconnect of working on first-world projects while living in a developing country. Although we used some sophisticated engineering software to design-built environment infrastructure, there were some grey areas and room for more efficient solutions both on-site and in the office, and I observed that there was a market for it, especially in Africa. The tools we used in the offshoring unit were way more sophisticated than the Africa business. Of which I do realise a lot of these efficiency solutions are a nice to have, especially for a country still facing BASIC infrastructure and asset management inadequacies.
												Last year, I had the opportunity to present on an emerging technology in the roads and transportation industry of my choice for our company's roads learning week. I presented on the value propositions of adopting the digital twin model in transportation systems. I further realized and concluded that it wasn't the engineering of the road that I was most interested in, but rather the development of tech solutions and systems to make the road and its systems more efficient that intrigued me the most. My identity as an engineer is an emotional one. I will forever be an engineer at heart, regardless of which industry I may transition to. And Elon Musk does admit we do make the best CEOs, so that's a pursuit worth charting.
												The skills and knowledge acquisitions I have garnered as an engineer are priceless, not only in the tools we use in the office, but also in the way we think, even outside of the office, we are intrinsic solutionists. I do wish we were more valued in the industry than we currently are in South Africa. Hence, the brain drains professionals. There's a synonymous saying that engineers are more valued outside of engineering than they are in engineering. And I hope that changes soon. We can't fully place the blame on engineering firms, but there is a blatant lack of funds for  the industry to fully thrive which trickles down to the young aspiring engineer with big dreams. The reality is that our country needs engineers, the civil engineering industry needs funding, and a vote of confidence from the government too. For now, as a young professional, I will continue to adapt to what the industry needs and where the cheese is 😊.

											<h3>McKinsey Forward Africa Program</h3>
											<p>I am a huge advocate for continuous learning and development. I have a background in a very technically heavy profession, and as I progressed in my career, I realized that there was a gap in the way I communicate my technical contributions to a project to higher-level non-technical executives. Loest Van Eeden always preaches that our product is only as good as how well we sell it. And thus, I intentionally decided to enroll in another program, this time a program that would assist me with practical "soft" skills needed to thrive today and in the future, such as adaptability, effective communication, digital agility, and emotional intelligence.

												After 20 weeks of interactive learning, I am now well-equipped to confidently face my tasks and learn and lead with purpose.</p>

											<h3>McKinsey Women in Engineering</h3>
											<p>As I began to consider alternative career paths beyond engineering, I discovered McKinsey's Women in Engineering program and had the opportunity to attend one of their networking events. This event provided an excellent platform for interacting with other women from diverse engineering backgrounds and gaining insights into McKinsey's operational practices and the role of consultants within their teams. By participating in this event, I was able to learn from women who had successfully made the transition from engineering to consulting, and I gained valuable knowledge on how they utilized their previous expertise in their new roles as operations consultants. Overall, attending this event was an enriching experience that broadened my understanding of potential career paths beyond engineering.</p>
